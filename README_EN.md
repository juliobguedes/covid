# COVID-19 Visualizations

[Clique aqui para ver em portuguÃªs](README_EN.md)

Hello! This repository is dedicated to keep the visualizations in the GitHub pages of this repository. You can access it [here](https://juliobguedes.codes/covid). The text inside this page is the primary source of information about this repository, while this readme is just an extra.

## About the visualizations

The purpose of the project is to create an interactive and timelapsed dashboard about how the COVID-19 spread in the world. 

To create the visualizations, we are using [d3js](https://github.com/d3). Differently from the expected, I haven't chosen the most recent version of d3, because a lot was changed between the versions 4 and 5. Since I was more used to the 4th version, I chose to keep it. Besides that, you can understand each step better by reading the notebooks.

## About the data

The data about the COVID-19 were and are being downloaded from the [Johns Hopkins University website](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases).

The tweets are being acquired using [twint](https://github.com/twintproject/twint).

## About the future

A few ideas have started being described in [the notebook about tweets](notebooks/Generating\-\Twitter\Dataset.ipynb), in which I describe how it is being acquired.
